This repository contains the implementation of predictive maintenance for gearboxes using vibration sensor data. We utilize Random Forest Table of Contents Introduction Data Collection Data Preprocessing Models Random Forest CNN Installation Usage Results Contributing License Introduction Predictive maintenance aims to predict the future failure of equipment so that maintenance can be performed just in time. This project focuses on predicting gearbox failures using vibration sensor data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to improve the reliability and efficiency of gearbox maintenance.

Data Collection The data used in this project consists of vibration readings collected from sensors attached to gearboxes. The dataset includes multiple features such as vibration amplitude, frequency, and other relevant metrics.

Data Preprocessing Data preprocessing steps include:

Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers. Normalization: Scaling the data to a standard range. Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features such as time-domain and frequency-domain features from raw vibration signals. Models Random Forest The Random Forest model is used for its robustness and ability to handle a large number of features. It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
